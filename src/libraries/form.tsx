          Form's headless and framework agnostic approach ensures maximum
          flexibility and broad compatibility with many front-end frameworks, or
          no framework at all. By both supplying and encouraging a headless
          approach to your forms, building custom reusable form components
          tailored to your application's needs{' '}
          <span className={twMerge('font-semibold', textStyles)}>
            requires little abstraction and keeps your code modular, simple and
            composable.

          When it comes to performance, TanStack Form delivers amazing speed and
          control, but without the cruft, boilerplate, or abstractions. With
          granularly reactive APIs at its core,{' '}
          <span className={twMerge('font-semibold', textStyles)}>
            only relevant components are updated when the form state changes.

          The end result? A faster UI, happy users, and zero worries about
          performance.
