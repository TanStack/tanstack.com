  neon: {
    whyGreat:
      'Neon gives teams real Postgres with lightweight branching and autoscaling compute, which is unusually useful for preview environments, testing, and fast iteration.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That lines up well with TanStack Start because apps often want standard Postgres semantics without giving up fast deploy workflows or branch-based development.',
  },
  convex: {
    whyGreat:
      'Convex combines a reactive database with TypeScript backend functions and automatic client updates, which removes a lot of glue code from realtime apps.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That is a strong fit for TanStack apps when you want server and client state to stay synchronized without wiring subscriptions and cache invalidation by hand.',
  },
  clerk: {
    whyGreat:
      'Clerk packages the painful parts of auth, including sign-in, sign-up, sessions, organizations, and MFA, into a well-documented product with good UI primitives.',
    whyTanStack:
      'Their official TanStack React Start and React Router support makes it easier to add auth without fighting route protection, session handling, and user flows.',
  },
  workos: {
    whyGreat:
      'WorkOS is built around the enterprise identity features B2B teams usually end up needing later: SSO, directory sync, RBAC, audit logs, and admin onboarding.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That complements TanStack well for B2B apps where auth and org-level access rules shape both routing and data access.',
  },
  'ag-grid': {
    whyGreat:
      'AG Grid earns its place when basic table rendering is not enough and you need serious grid behavior like grouping, pivoting, or a server-side row model.',
    whyTanStack:
      'It pairs naturally with TanStack Table when you want TanStack flexibility for state and data modeling alongside a heavier-duty grid UI.',
  },
  netlify: {
    whyGreat:
      'Netlify makes deployment workflows simple, especially when preview environments and edge or server functions are part of the product workflow.',
    whyTanStack:
      'Their published TanStack Start support means the integration story is concrete, not hand-wavy.',
  },
  cloudflare: {
    whyGreat:
      'Cloudflare stands out when global distribution, edge compute, caching, and security need to be part of the platform rather than bolted on later.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That can be a strong fit for TanStack Start apps that want to run close to users on Workers and take advantage of bindings and prerendering support.',
  },
  sentry: {
    whyGreat:
      'Sentry turns production issues into actionable debugging data instead of just error logs, especially once tracing and replay are in the mix.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That matters for TanStack apps with richer client behavior, and Sentry already documents TanStack Router support plus an alpha TanStack Start React SDK.',
  },
  fireship: {
    whyGreat:
      'Fireship and Bytes are useful because they help developers stay current quickly through short-form education, courses, and newsletter coverage.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That makes them a good ecosystem fit when you want more developers to discover and understand TanStack patterns.',
  },
  nozzle: {
    whyGreat:
      'Nozzle is a serious SEO product with enterprise rank tracking, share-of-voice reporting, and deep SERP data, not a generic marketing dashboard.',
    whyTanStack:
      'It is relevant here because it has long been part of the broader TanStack story and shows the kind of data-heavy product surfaces this ecosystem can support.',
  },
  speakeasy: {
    whyGreat:
      'Speakeasy is specific and useful: it generates SDKs, CLIs, Terraform providers, and hosted MCP servers from OpenAPI specs.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That lines up well with TanStack apps when your frontend depends on well-generated client libraries instead of hand-maintained API integrations.',
  },
  unkey: {
    whyGreat:
      'Unkey focuses on the practical API infrastructure teams need early: keys, rate limits, access policies, and usage tracking.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That is a good fit for TanStack-built products that expose APIs or need straightforward platform controls around API access.',
  },
  serpapi: {
    whyGreat:
      'SerpApi handles the ugly parts of search data access, including proxies, CAPTCHA solving, localization, and structured parsing.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That pairs well with TanStack when search intelligence, SEO tooling, or agent workflows are part of the product.',
  },
  electric: {
    whyGreat:
      'Electric is interesting because it focuses on sync and reactive data delivery rather than asking teams to rebuild their stack around a new database abstraction.',
    whyTanStack:
      'Its partnership around TanStack DB makes it especially relevant for apps that want local-first or sync-heavy behavior with a strong client-side data experience.',
  },
  vercel: {
    whyGreat:
      'Vercel is strongest when preview workflows, Git-based deployment, global delivery, and server-side compute are central to the team workflow.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That has been a natural fit for TanStack Start and Router teams building full-stack apps with modern deployment workflows.',
  },
  prisma: {
    whyGreat:
      'Prisma is useful because it combines type-safe database access, migrations, and a strong developer workflow instead of only being a query builder.',
    whyTanStack:
      'Its official TanStack Start guide and Prisma Postgres workflow make it a practical option for full-stack TanStack apps that want a polished DB layer.',
  },
  coderabbit: {
    whyGreat:
      'CodeRabbit adds automated review, scanner context, and one-click fixes directly into pull request and IDE workflows.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That is relevant for TanStack because these codebases benefit from fast feedback on correctness and usage patterns, not just formatting.',
  },
  strapi: {
    whyGreat:
      'Strapi is a pragmatic headless CMS choice for teams that want structured content, generated APIs, and strong customization without locking themselves into a closed stack.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That works well with TanStack Start when you want a real content system behind an app-shaped frontend.',
  },
  powersync: {
    whyGreat:
      'PowerSync is built for one of the harder app problems: keeping client-side SQLite in sync with backend data for offline-first and realtime behavior.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That makes it relevant for TanStack DB and Query users who care about local-first UX and reactive client state.',
  },
  railway: {
    whyGreat:
      'Railway reduces deployment friction and gives teams a single place to run app services, databases, networking, and observability.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That simplicity is a good match for TanStack teams that want to ship full-stack apps quickly without building a platform team first.',
  },
  openrouter: {
    whyGreat:
      'OpenRouter normalizes access to many model providers behind one API and gives teams routing and fallback controls they would otherwise build themselves.',
    whyTanStack:
      'That is a strong fit for TanStack apps experimenting with AI features where provider choice, latency, cost, and fallback behavior change over time.',
