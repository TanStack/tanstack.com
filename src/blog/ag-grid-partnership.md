We're excited to announce that [AG Grid](https://ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/?utm_source=reacttable&utm_campaign=githubreacttable) is now the official **TanStack Table** open-source partner! Together we will strive to achieve the following goals:

- To jointly educate the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem about the differences between the two libraries and when to choose which.
- To cover as many use-cases as possible across the ecosystem by encouraging the usage of the other when goals and limitations of either are not met.
- To improve the quality of both libraries through shared experience, knowledge and even code when appropriate.

TanStack Table and [AG Grid](https://ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/?utm_source=reacttable&utm_campaign=githubreacttable) share the same general problem space, but are implemented via drastically different architectures and paradigms, each offering unique trade-offs, opinions and optimizations depending on use-case. These differences and trade-offs are complimentary to one another and together form what we believe are the best two datagrid/table options available in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem.

To learn about the differences and trade-offs between the two libraries, start by reading the [introduction to TanStack Table](/table/v8/docs/introduction) and the [introduction to AG Grid](https://ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/?utm_source=reacttable&utm_campaign=githubreacttable)!

We are excited about the future of datagrids and tables and we at TanStack are honored that AG Grid is invested in the success of it's open source ecosystem!
