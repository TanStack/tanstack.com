- **Developer-first tools** â€“ Instant previews, automated workflows, and seamless integrations make building a joy.

## Why Netlify?

Netlify is more than just a deployment providerâ€”theyâ€™ve worked closely with us to ensure that deploying TanStack Start applications is not just fast, but optimized for the best possible developer experience. Whether youâ€™re building interactive UIs, data-heavy dashboards, real-time tools, or AI-powered applications, Netlifyâ€™s platform makes the process seamless.

As part of this partnership, Netlify has also launched a **full-stack AI chatbot starter template** that showcases TanStack Startâ€™s powerful data management capabilities alongside Netlify Functions. This template provides:

- **Real-time data handling** with TanStack Query
