![TanStack Start v1 Release Candidate](/blog-assets/announcing-tanstack-start-v1/header.png)

TanStack Start has officially reached a **v1.0 Release Candidate**. This is the build we expect to ship as 1.0, pending your final feedback, docs polish, and a few last-mile fixes. Now’s the perfect time to kick the tires and help us validate the final stretch. When 1.0 ships, we’ll update this post (same URL) with any final notes.

## Why this matters

TanStack Start isn’t just another framework, it’s the next chapter in building type-safe, high-performance React apps without the heavy abstractions. Whether you’re coming from classic SPAs or dipping into SSR, Start gives you the flexibility to scale in the direction that fits your team.

## What’s in v1

- **Type-safe, file-based routing** powered by TanStack Router
- **Server-first ergonomics** with isomorphic server functions
- **Built-in streaming**; **React Server Components** support is on the way
- **URL-as-state primitives** with runtime validation and full type-safety
- **Great SPA and SSR DX** with no lock-in or opaque magic
- **Deep Query integration** for prefetching, caching, and hydration

## Get started or upgrade

Follow the Getting Started guide to spin up a fresh app or upgrade an existing one:

- [TanStack Start Docs](/start)

That page will stay current with the exact commands for the RC and the final 1.0.

## Path to 1.0 stable

We plan to cut 1.0 shortly after collecting RC feedback. Expect a few small RC iterations; any breaking changes will be clearly documented. As we approach stable, only light polish remains—no major API shifts.

> **Note:** React Server Components support is in active development and will land as a non-breaking v1.x addition.
