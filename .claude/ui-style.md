# UI Style Guide 2026

## Layout

- Fewer, well-defined containers over many small sections
- Generous spacing creates separation before adding visual effects
- Cards are acceptable when they express grouping or hierarchy

## Corners

- Rounded corners are standard
- Subtle radius values that feel intentional, not playful
- Avoid sharp 90-degree corners unless intentionally industrial

## Shadows and Depth

- Soft, low-contrast, diffused shadows
- Shadows imply separation, not elevation theatrics
- No heavy drop shadows or strong directional lighting
- One to two shadow layers max

## Cards

- Cards should feel grounded, not floating
- Light elevation, border plus shadow, or surface contrast
- Don't overuse cards as a default layout primitive

## Color and Surfaces

- Soft neutrals, off-whites, warm grays
- Surface contrast or translucency instead of strong outlines
- Glass/frosted effects acceptable when subtle and accessible

## Interaction

- Micro transitions reinforce spatial relationships
- Hover/focus states feel responsive, not animated
- No excessive motion or springy effects

## Typography

- Strong headings, calm body text
- No visual noise around content

## What to Avoid

- Chunky shadows
- Overly flat, sterile layouts
- Neumorphism as primary style
- Over-designed card grids

**Summary: If depth does not improve comprehension, remove it.**
