# Analytics

Reference for the TanStack.com event taxonomy in Google Analytics 4.

**GA4 property:** `G-JMT1Z50SPS`
**First-party proxy:** all hits route through `/_a/g/collect` on tanstack.com (see `netlify.toml`)
**Implementation:** [src/utils/analytics.ts](../src/utils/analytics.ts), [src/utils/analytics/events.ts](../src/utils/analytics/events.ts)

## Design principles

1. **Event names describe what happened.** Properties carry context. Adding a new partner placement is an enum value, not a new event.
2. **One event per outcome, not per intent.** No `_clicked`/`_attempted` events when an outcome event is going to fire anyway.
3. **No per-row events.** Counts and joined-string arrays as properties, not N rows per generation.
4. **Session context propagates.** Slow-changing props like `mode_used` and `idea_used` are stamped on every builder event so any breakdown works without joins.
5. **Typed registry.** Wrong props for an event = TypeScript error, not silent bad data.

## The funnel

Application Builder, four steps. No `OR` conditions, no overlapping event names.

| # | Step | Event | Filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Landed on builder | `page_view` | `page_type = application_builder` |
| 2 | Got an analysis | `builder_analyzed` | — |
| 3 | Got a generation | `builder_generated` | — |
| 4 | Took action on result | `builder_activated` | — |

Drop-off between any two steps is unambiguous.

**Failure rates** are separate explorations, not branches off the funnel:

- Analysis failure rate = `builder_failed[stage=analysis]` ÷ (`builder_analyzed` + `builder_failed[stage=analysis]`)
- Generation failure rate = `builder_failed[stage=generation]` ÷ (`builder_generated` + `builder_failed[stage=generation]`)
- Login wall rate = `builder_failed[stage=login_blocked]` ÷ `page_view[page_type=application_builder]`

## Event reference (9 events)

Every event automatically receives `page_location`, `page_path`, `page_title`, `page_type` from the analytics utility.

### `page_view`
Fires on initial load (auto from gtag config) and on every SPA navigation.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `page_location` | string | Full URL |
| `page_path` | string | Pathname |
| `page_title` | string | `document.title` |
| `page_type` | enum | `home`, `partners_index`, `partner_detail`, `blog_index`, `blog_post`, `docs`, `partners_embed`, `application_builder`, `page` |

---

### `partner_viewed`
A partner UI element scrolled ≥50% into the viewport. Fires once per element-mount per session (the underlying `IntersectionObserver` disconnects after first fire).

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `partner_id` | string | Stable partner identifier |
| `placement` | enum | See `PartnerPlacement` below |
| `slot_index` | number? | Position in the surface (0-indexed) when applicable |

**Note on inflation:** when filters change on the partners directory, cards unmount/remount and `partner_viewed` re-fires. Treat session-unique impressions as the dedup'd metric (compute in BigQuery with `FIRST_VALUE(... PARTITION BY session_id, partner_id)`).

---

### `partner_clicked`
User clicked a partner UI element to navigate somewhere.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `partner_id` | string | |
| `placement` | enum | See `PartnerPlacement` below |
| `destination` | enum | `external` (partner's site) or `internal_detail` (our partner detail page) |
| `destination_host` | string? | Host of the destination URL when `external` |
| `slot_index` | number? | Position in the surface when applicable |

CTR per placement = `partner_clicked` ÷ `partner_viewed` filtered to same `placement`.

---

### `partner_filter_applied`
User changed the filter state on the partners directory.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `change` | enum | `libraries_changed`, `status_changed`, `cleared_all` |
| `library_filters` | string | Comma-joined library ids in the filter, or empty string |
| `status_filter` | string \| null | `null` means "no status filter applied" — distinguishes from "user explicitly chose 'active'" |
| `result_count` | number | Number of partners visible after the filter |

---

### `partner_inquiry_started`
User clicked a "get in touch", "let's chat", or "become a partner" CTA.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `placement` | enum | `partners_index_cta`, `library_callout`, `docs_right_rail` |

---

### `builder_analyzed`
Analysis API call succeeded. Outcome event — always preceded by user intent, no separate `_requested` event.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mode_used` | enum | Session context: `lucky`, `confident`, `none` |
| `idea_used` | string | Session context: idea label, or `none` |
| `analysis_deployment` | string? | Inferred deploy target |
| `inferred_library_count` | number | |
| `inferred_partner_count` | number | |
| `feature_count` | number | |

---

### `builder_generated`
Generation API call succeeded.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mode_used` | enum | Session context |
| `idea_used` | string | Session context |
| `final_deployment` | string? | The chosen deploy target on the final result |
| `final_package_manager` | string | `pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`, `bun` |
| `final_library_count` | number | |
| `final_partner_count` | number | |
| `final_addon_count` | number | |
| `library_ids` | string | Comma-joined LibraryIds — use `SPLIT()` in BigQuery for top-N analysis |
| `partner_ids` | string | Comma-joined |
| `addon_ids` | string | Comma-joined |

---

### `builder_failed`
Single umbrella event for analysis failures, generation failures, and login-wall blocks. Use the `stage` prop to distinguish.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mode_used` | enum | Session context |
| `idea_used` | string | Session context |
| `stage` | enum | `analysis`, `generation`, `login_blocked` |
| `error_message` | string? | Free-form error message — high cardinality, don't register as a dimension; query in BigQuery |
| `retry_after` | number? | Seconds until retry permitted (login_blocked only) |
| `anonymous_generations_remaining` | number? | When the failure was rate-limit related |

---

### `builder_activated`
User took an action on the generated result. Single event with `action` prop covers all post-generation actions.

| Prop | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mode_used` | enum | Session context |
| `idea_used` | string | Session context |
| `action` | enum | See `BuilderAction` below |
| `surface` | enum | `result_panel` (main builder UI) or `deploy_dialog` |
| `provider` | string? | Deploy provider when applicable: `vercel`, `netlify`, `cloudflare` |
| `automatic` | boolean | `true` for system-driven actions (e.g., deploy_dialog auto-redirect countdown). Filter to `false` for true user click rates. |

**Important:** automatic prompt-copies that fire as a side-effect of generation do NOT emit `builder_activated`. Only user-driven actions count as activation.

---

## Enums

### `PartnerPlacement`
| Value | Where it appears |
|---|---|
| `directory` | Partner cards in `/partners` index |
| `detail` | Partner detail page CTA |
| `docs_rail` | Right rail on docs pages — partner cards AND the "Become a Partner" link both fire with this placement (event name distinguishes) |
| `blog_rail` | Right rail on blog pages |
| `grid` | Generic partners grid (fallback) |
| `home_grid` | Home page social-proof grid |
| `library_grid` | Library page partners section — filter `page_path` to know which library |
| `embed_grid` | Partners embed view |
| `docs_strip` | Mobile partner strip in docs |
| `ecosystem_game` | 3D ecosystem game islands |
| `partners_index_cta` | "Get in touch" mailto on `/partners` |
| `library_callout` | "Let's chat" callout per library |

### `BuilderAction`
| Value | Means |
|---|---|

| `open_repo` | Opened the project repo from the deploy dialog |

---

## Session context

`mode_used` and `idea_used` are tracked in the builder hook and stamped on **every** builder event. This means any builder event can be sliced by mode or idea without session joins.

**`mode_used`** transitions:
- `none` → `lucky` when user clicks "I'm feeling lucky"
- `none` → `confident` when user clicks "I'm feeling confident"

**`idea_used`** transitions:
- `none` → idea label string when user picks a suggested idea
- Reset back to `none` if user clears or types fresh input (TBD — currently sticks for the session)

## Custom dimensions to register in GA4

Admin → Custom definitions → Create custom dimension. **Event scope** for all of these. Without registration, they're stored in BigQuery export but invisible in the GA4 UI.

| Dimension name | API name | Used on |
|---|---|---|
| Placement | `placement` | partner_viewed, partner_clicked, partner_inquiry_started |
| Partner ID | `partner_id` | partner_viewed, partner_clicked |
| Mode used | `mode_used` | all builder events |
| Idea used | `idea_used` | all builder events |
| Action | `action` | builder_activated |
| Surface | `surface` | builder_activated |
| Stage | `stage` | builder_failed |
| Final deployment | `final_deployment` | builder_generated |
| Final package manager | `final_package_manager` | builder_generated |
| Final library count | `final_library_count` | builder_generated |
| Final partner count | `final_partner_count` | builder_generated |
| Page type | `page_type` | all events |

12 dimensions. Well under the 50-dimension event-scoped limit.

**Don't register:** `error_message`, `library_ids`, `partner_ids`, `addon_ids`, `destination_host`. High cardinality. Query in BigQuery.

---

## Common GA4 queries

### "What's our funnel completion rate?"
**Explore → Funnel exploration**, four steps as defined above. Open funnel. Show elapsed time.

### "Lucky vs Confident: which mode converts better?"
Same funnel, breakdown dropdown = `mode_used`. Compare side by side.

### "Which deploy targets do successful generations land on?"
**Explore → Free-form**, dimension = `final_deployment`, metric = event count of `builder_generated`.

### "What % of users hit the login wall?"
Free-form, filter `event_name = builder_failed`, breakdown by `stage`.

### "Which placement converts best for partner discovery?"
Free-form, filter `event_name = partner_clicked OR partner_viewed`, breakdown by `placement`. Compute CTR yourself: clicks ÷ views per placement.

### "Top 10 libraries in completed generations"
Requires BigQuery — `library_ids` is high-cardinality. Sample query:

```sql
SELECT
  library_id,
  COUNT(*) AS generations
FROM `tanstack.analytics_*.events_*`,
UNNEST(SPLIT((SELECT value.string_value
              FROM UNNEST(event_params)
              WHERE key = 'library_ids'), ',')) AS library_id
WHERE event_name = 'builder_generated'
  AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20260101' AND '20260131'
GROUP BY library_id
ORDER BY generations DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## BigQuery export

**Strongly recommended.** Free at our event volume. Without it, anything beyond stock reports is painful.

Setup:
1. GA4 Admin → BigQuery Links → Link
2. Pick a GCP project, daily export, US multi-region
3. Tables appear at `tanstack.analytics_<property_id>.events_YYYYMMDD` after ~24h

Once enabled, all event properties are queryable — including the ones not registered as custom dimensions. Use SQL for everything dimensional or aggregate-heavy. Use the GA4 UI for funnel exploration and headline numbers.

## Adding new events

Anything additive should not require schema migration of the existing taxonomy.

**Add a new partner placement:**
1. Add the value to `PartnerPlacement` in [src/utils/analytics/events.ts](../src/utils/analytics/events.ts)
2. Use it at the call site
3. (Optional) update the placement table in this doc

**Add a new builder action:**
1. Add the value to `BuilderAction`
2. Use it at the `builder_activated` call site

**Add a new event:**
1. Add a new union member to `AnalyticsEvent` with its prop interface
2. Call `trackEvent({ name: '...', props: { ... } })`
3. Register relevant breakdown props as custom dimensions in GA4 admin
4. Document the event in this file

**Don't:** add new properties to existing events without updating both the type definition and this doc. Schema drift in analytics events is the slowest bug to detect.

## Migration history

### 2026-05 — schema v2
Collapsed 28 events into 9. Removed `application_starter_*` event family. Replaced with `builder_*` events. Mode and idea selection moved from standalone events into session-context props on every builder event.

**Events removed entirely** (no replacement):
- `application_starter_library_toggled`, `_integration_toggled`, `_package_manager_toggled`, `_toolchain_toggled` — config exploration depth no longer tracked. Final config is on `builder_generated`.
- `application_starter_continue_clicked`, `_generate_clicked` — intent implied by outcome events.
- `application_starter_login_clicked`, `_value_copied` (auto), `_builder_result_applied`, `_final_partner_in_prompt`, `_final_addon_in_prompt`.

**Events folded into others:**
- `application_starter_action_clicked` (mode_selected) → `mode_used` prop on subsequent events
- `application_starter_idea_selected` → `idea_used` prop on subsequent events
- `application_starter_login_required` → `builder_failed[stage=login_blocked]`
- `application_starter_value_copied` (user trigger) → `builder_activated[action=copy_prompt]`
- All other `application_starter_action_clicked` calls → `builder_activated`
- `partner_card_clicked`, `partner_click` → `partner_clicked`
- `partner_impression`, `partner_detail_viewed` → `partner_viewed`
- `partners_filter_changed` → `partner_filter_applied`
- `partner_inquiry_clicked`, `become_partner_clicked` → `partner_inquiry_started`

Historical data with old event names is still queryable in GA4 and BigQuery. Cutover date: see git log for the migration commit.
